lorimg
==================

Cloned the idea from http://motyar.blogspot.com/2010/09/create-image-placeholder-with-php.html and adjusted the url interface more similar to http://placehold.it/ placeholder image service.

Drop this on your project or personal server to host your own placeholder images.  Sometimes, this is more reliable than depending on http://placehold.it/.

## Usage
```
<img src="http://lorimg.dericmendez.com/400x800" alt="400x800" />
<img src="http://lorimg.dericmendez.com/300x900/ff9900" alt="300x900 with a #ff9900 background color" />
<img src="http://lorimg.dericmendez.com/800x1200/000000/ffffff" alt="800x1200 with a black background and white text" />
```
